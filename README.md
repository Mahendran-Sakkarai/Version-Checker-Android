# Version Checker Android
This library is used to check whether your current app has any latest version. I am using a db in my server to store the applicationId and it's latest version. I'll update the version to the server when the first user updated the app. So using that other users will be get a update information.
 
To use this library use the below dependency in the application level `build.gradle`
> compile 'com.yaiyaiyaa.android:versionchecker:0.2.0'

Currently it is not available for public use. Working on that.
